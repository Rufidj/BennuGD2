Important Notes        : This map may be reproduced in its original format
			 (And by 'original format' I mean 'the unmodified
			 zipfile') in any media that now exists (the Internet, 
			 DVDs, carrier pidgeon, etched stone tablets) or will 
			 exist in the future (Infonet, IPv6 Internet, UberLazarDisk,
			 StarFleet Databanks) as long as all files are unmodified, 
			 credit is given to the original author (Supertanker), 
			 and there is no charge or fee beyond reasonable distribution
			 fees (The cost of a CD-R, bandwidth, packaging, or distribution media). 
			 Commercial use of this level (Say, in a total conversion that is 
			 'commercial' and costs well more than the cost of the distribution media)
			 is prohibited. After all, I put all the sweat into this level, not you,
			 and I am certainly not getting paid for it or for distributing it.

			 Although I'd prefer you didn't, you may use this level as a
			 base for a new level (As long as it is released under the same 
			 terms as dictated above), so long as credit is clearly given to 
			 the original author (Cody "Supertanker" Jackson) for designing the base map.
